# Task-it-up By Taha Shaikh 
## This is a full stack to-do app. 
### Secure, frontend-backend, complete functioning. 

I will add more details to this readme slowly. 

Intention is to make functioning, even if scrappy looking application. 
It would allow users to securely log in/ register and have a good todo list app.
The password will be secured in a database and encrypted.
Session maintenance, cache, clearance, log-in again, etc would happen. 
This would be available to actual use for anyone as it would be deployed.

### (------ technical details start -----------)
1. Root dir has python venv (since flask is used for backend), gitignore, Readme file, requirements.txt 
2. backend directory has structure per flask convention where in app.py is the entry point for the applcation
3. hello
